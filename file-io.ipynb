    "\n",
    "“We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the\n",
    "better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its\n",
    "original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that\n",
    "its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to\n",
    "assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not\n",
    "the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive\n",
    "conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be\n",
    "no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the\n",
    "opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty\n",
    "of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines\n",
    "of Pope.—\n",
    "\n",
    "“‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit\n",
    "Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,\n",
    "How parts relate to parts, or they to whole,\n",
    "The body’s harmony, the beaming soul,\n",
    "Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,\n",
    "When man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”[19]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning\n",
    "the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and\n",
    "cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,[20]\n",
    "the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern\n",
    "critics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an\n",
    "opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the\n",
    "Iliad,[21] and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names[22]\n",
    "it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal\n",
    "non-existence of Homer ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems\n",
    "to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what\n",
    "are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on\n",
    "the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel\n",
    "of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and\n",
    "good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs\n",
    "were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about\n",
    "Peisistratus’ time, about five hundred years after.”[23]\n",
    "\n",
    "Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on\n",
    "the subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico, that we\n",
    "first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf\n",
    "with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian\n",
    "theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold\n",
    "hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—[24]\n",
    "\n",
    "“Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\n",
    "turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\n",
    "published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of\n",
    "the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by\n",
    "no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously\n",
    "announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent\n",
    "portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into\n",
    "any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of\n",
    "Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards\n",
    "that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem\n",
    "could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their\n",
    "composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect\n",
    "symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived\n",
    "by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to\n",
    "posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be\n",
    "indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,\n",
    "was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive\n",
    "integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading\n",
    "opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to\n",
    "have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered\n",
    "incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the\n",
    "Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the\n",
    "beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "“To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to\n",
    "Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are\n",
    "nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that\n",
    "view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to\n",
    "controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long\n",
    "written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian æra. Few\n",
    "things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,\n",
    "opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than\n",
    "Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh\n",
    "century before the Christian æra, are exceedingly trifling. We have no\n",
    "remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early\n",
    "inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure\n",
    "ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus,\n",
    "Tyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,\n",
    "committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice\n",
    "of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes\n",
    "us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous\n",
    "ordinance of Solôn, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenæa:\n",
    "but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are\n",
    "unable to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the\n",
    "beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the\n",
    "existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit\n",
    "generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and\n",
    "heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been\n",
    "manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted\n",
    "memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here\n",
    "we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the\n",
    "existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,[25] is\n",
    "far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age\n",
    "essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable\n",
    "instruments and materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover,\n",
    "there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under\n",
    "no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript; for\n",
    "if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification\n",
    "for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the\n",
    "example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of\n",
    "Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as\n",
    "the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The\n",
    "author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a\n",
    "blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been\n",
    "conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant\n",
    "reference to the manuscript in his chest.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon\n",
    "which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond\n",
    "a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a\n",
    "considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the\n",
    "Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies\n",
    "been preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry, for instance, had not been\n",
    "written, it could only have come down to us in a softened form, more\n",
    "like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble\n",
    "original.\n",
    "\n",
    "“At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other\n",
    "Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,\n",
    "though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of\n",
    "Solôn. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any\n",
    "more determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What\n",
    "were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its\n",
    "first commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a\n",
    "written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was\n",
    "not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,\n",
    "and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of\n",
    "voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for\n",
    "emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never\n",
    "reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive\n",
    "it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn\n",
    "and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would\n",
    "be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of\n",
    "readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\n",
    "experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\n",
    "written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\n",
    "impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\n",
    "seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\n",
    "there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.\n",
    "If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be\n",
    "formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic\n",
    "poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with\n",
    "the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the\n",
    "formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle\n",
    "of the seventh century before the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C.\n",
    "630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of\n",
    "Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in\n",
    "the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac\n",
    "and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the\n",
    "primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred\n",
    "from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a\n",
    "change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of\n",
    "publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the\n",
    "nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at\n",
    "the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new\n",
    "poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be\n",
    "considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\n",
    "own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric\n",
    "rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and\n",
    "eulogized the Thebaïs as the production of Homer. There seems,\n",
    "therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this\n",
    "newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the\n",
    "Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebaïs and the Cypria, as well\n",
    "as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle\n",
    "of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian\n",
    "commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish\n",
    "increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.\n",
    "A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and\n",
    "the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of\n",
    "Solôn, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though\n",
    "still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized\n",
    "authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness\n",
    "of individual rhapsodes.”[26]\n",
    "\n",
    "But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of\n",
    "the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following\n",
    "observations—\n",
    "\n",
    "“There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,\n",
    "throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid\n",
    "compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its\n",
    "present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian\n",
    "ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of\n",
    "Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the\n",
    "fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonidês were\n",
    "employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much\n",
    "must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is\n",
    "almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should\n",
    "not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies\n",
    "which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the\n",
    "Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have\n",
    "perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have\n",
    "caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the\n",
    "heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the\n",
    "Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic\n",
    "dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing\n",
    "characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,\n",
    "particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,\n",
    "should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient\n",
    "and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such\n",
    "a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an\n",
    "imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott\n",
    "has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.\n",
    "\n",
    "“If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian\n",
    "compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total\n",
    "absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of\n",
    "observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,\n",
    "the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their\n",
    "ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece\n",
    "embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and\n",
    "insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their\n",
    "ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,\n",
    "indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic\n",
    "fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against\n",
    "the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadæ, the chieftain\n",
    "of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have\n",
    "been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the\n",
    "preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have\n",
    "forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.\n",
    "The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of\n",
    "far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid\n",
    "would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian\n",
    "synod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.\n",
    "Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the\n",
    "hero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are\n",
    "sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its\n",
    "direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic\n",
    "cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout\n",
    "the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship\n",
    "of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have\n",
    "at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring\n",
    "neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial to the\n",
    "almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the\n",
    "questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled\n",
    "in the military tactics of his age.”[27]\n",

    "To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that\n",
    "Wolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey\n",
    "have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they\n",
    "have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the\n",
    "difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather\n",
    "augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is\n",
    "Lachmann’s[28] modification of his theory any better. He divides the\n",
    "first twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and\n",
    "treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one\n",
    "regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus.\n",
    "This, as Grote observes, “explains the gaps and contradictions in the\n",
    "narrative, but it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no\n",
    "contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets\n",
    "concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle\n",

    "Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the\n",
    "Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes\n",

    "that “it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have\n",
    "so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.”\n",
    "The discrepancy, by which Pylæmenes, who is represented as dead in the\n",

    "regarded as the result of an interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the\n",
    "subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian\n",
    "theory, and of Lachmann’s modifications with the character of\n",
    "Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,\n",
    "that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,\n",
    "or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by\n",
    "Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In\n",
    "short, “a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of\n",
    "pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the\n",
    "period of its first compilation.” The friends or literary _employês_ of\n",
    "Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the\n",
    "silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic\n",

    "“Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems themselves\n",
    "confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad\n",
    "or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age\n",
    "of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations\n",
    "brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined\n",
    "money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican\n",
    "governments, the close military array, the improved construction of\n",
    "ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of\n",
    "religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c.,\n",
    "familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the\n",
    "other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to\n",
    "notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,\n",
    "undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into\n",
    "one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in\n",
    "substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries\n",
    "earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those\n",
    "passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray\n",
    "no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been\n",
    "heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and\n",
    "Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter.[29] As far as the evidences on the\n",
    "case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge, we seem\n",
    "warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited\n",
    "substantially as they now stand (always allowing for partial\n",
    "divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first\n",
    "trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient date, let it be\n",
    "added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most\n",
    "important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to\n",
    "Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the\n",
    "anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the\n",
    "subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive\n",
    "contrasts between their former and their later condition.”[30]\n",
    "\n",
    "On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of\n",
    "Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must\n",
    "confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his\n",
    "labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition\n",
    "or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the\n",
    "work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and\n",
    "elegant mind of that Athenian[31] would lead him to preserve an ancient\n",
    "and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and\n",
    "re-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat\n",
    "the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,\n",
    "or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed\n",
    "author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we\n",
    "are upon either subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the\n",
    "preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version\n",
    "of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical\n",
    "probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the\n",
    "Spartan Confucius.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,\n",
    "made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like\n",
    "consistency. It is as follows:—\n",
    "\n",
    "“No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors\n",
    "of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent\n",
    "music’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the\n",
    "United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\n",
    "around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\n",
    "spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\n",
    "mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\n",
    "which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\n",
    "was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\n",
    "and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\n",
    "recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\n",
    "probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\n",
    "memory considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\n",
    "poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most\n",
    "probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great\n",
    "utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of\n",
    "Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them\n",
    "by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the\n",
    "‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,\n",
    "which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic\n",
    "dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He\n",
    "therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\n",
    "rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging\n",
    "arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,\n",
    "arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast\n",
    "pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere\n",
    "arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.’\n",
    "\n",
    "“While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,\n",
    "recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized\n",
    "the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleïs[32] grew under\n",
    "his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem\n",
    "under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays\n",
    "of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the\n",
    "Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that\n",
    "the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but,\n",
    "first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and\n",
    "corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,\n",
    "assemblies, and agoras. However, Solôn first, and then Peisistratus,\n",
    "and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored\n",
    "the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great\n",
    "measure.”[33]\n",
    "\n",
    "Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which\n",
    "have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I\n",
    "must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of\n",
    "the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations\n",
    "disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here\n",
    "and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of\n",
    "the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a\n",
    "higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or\n",
    "enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of\n",
    "their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari\n",
    "eum jus fasque sit_, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of\n",
    "historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these\n",
    "great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal\n",
    "evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate\n",
    "impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minutiæ of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.\n",
    "Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an\n",
    "attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its\n",
    "importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on\n",
    "its æsthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the\n",
    "emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had\n",
    "they been suggested to the author by his Mæcenas or Africanus, he\n",
    "would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in\n",
    "laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often\n",
    "least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not\n",
    "poets by profession, but may be so _per accidens_. I do not at this\n",
    "moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially\n",
    "improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from\n",
    "Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute\n",
    "points, without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will\n",
    "exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an\n",
    "heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously\n",
    "dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the\n",
    "pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their\n",
    "wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book\n",
    "after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a\n",
    "collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the\n",
    "works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile\n",
    "counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of\n",
    "Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of\n",
    "the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of\n",
    "Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his\n",
    "theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would\n",
    "explain by omitting something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon\n",
    "as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,\n",
    "seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies\n",
    "attributed to Seneca are by _four_ different authors.[34] Now, I will\n",
    "venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in\n",
    "their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like\n",
    "Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselves—in their\n",
    "freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined\n",
    "and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the\n",
    "present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman, be\n",
    "he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more\n",
    "equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world\n",
    "with the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil, and the\n",
    "satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without wishing to\n",
    "say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the\n",
    "refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this\n",
    "subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric\n",
    "theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather\n",
    "than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the\n",
    "literary history of more recent times will account for many points of\n",
    "difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so\n",
    "remote from that of their first creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus\n",
    "were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason\n",
    "why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in\n",
    "his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should\n",
    "have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after\n",
    "all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand\n",
    "too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully\n",
    "appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has\n",
    "sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much\n",
    "violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with\n",
    "love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author\n",
    "of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human\n",
    "invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most\n",
    "ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the\n",
    "contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the\n",
    "very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a\n",
    "mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.\n",
    "\n",
    "While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature\n",
    "herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in\n",
    "believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers\n",
    "round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth\n",
    "of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am\n",
    "far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a\n",
    "rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence\n",
    "he might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to\n",
    "_use_ existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to\n",
    "patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style\n",
    "and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what\n",
    "bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?\n",
    "\n",
    "A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other\n",
    "bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In\n",
    "fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward\n",
    "impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents\n",
    "which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be\n",
    "some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly\n",
    "stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never\n",
    "come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most\n",
    "pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and\n",
    "great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more\n",
    "substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to\n",
    "create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and\n",
    "embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a\n",
    "parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their\n",
    "wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will\n",
    "require little acuteness to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware\n",
    "as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,\n",
    "it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved\n",
    "for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature\n",
    "intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which\n",
    "the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were\n",
    "faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our\n",
    "ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary\n",
    "lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried\n",
    "touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon\n",
    "the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached\n",
    "to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse\n",
    "the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing\n",
    "apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic\n",

    "Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts\n",
    "even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and\n",
    "with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply\n",
    "wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots\n",
    "which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must\n",
    "transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination\n",
    "must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the\n",
    "same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but\n",
    "attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely\n",
    "suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of\n",
    "Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer\n",
    "that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems\n",

    "“It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has\n",
    "ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen.\n",
    "Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other\n",
    "nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is\n",
    "a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the\n",
    "period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in\n",
    "Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they\n",
    "paid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the\n",
    "mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no\n",
    "less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity\n",
    "and truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;\n",
    "on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which\n",
    "outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth\n",
    "from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and\n",
    "therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which\n",
    "cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,\n",
    "from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down\n",
    "on his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests\n",
    "of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic\n",
    "wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast\n",
    "assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had\n",

    "“This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of ancient date.\n",

    "corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile\n",
    "essay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,\n",
    "mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited\n",

    "uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,\n",
    "know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining\n",
    "the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a\n",
    "youthful profusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the\n",

    "general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and\n",
    "even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the\n",
    "objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque\n",
    "to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse\n",
    "that order in the development of national taste, which the history of\n",
    "every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost\n",
    "ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society\n",
    "much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that\n",
    "any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is\n",
    "contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three\n",
    "other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as\n",
    "much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of\n",
    "them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word\n",
    "deltos, “writing tablet,” instead of διφθέρα, “skin,” which, according\n",
    "to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for\n",
    "that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity;\n",
    "and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a\n",
    "strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.”\n",

    "Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s\n",
    "design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,\n",
    "and on my own purpose in the present edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his\n",
    "earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.\n",
    "It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a\n",
    "disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\n",
    "deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his\n",
    "whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\n",
    "translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,\n",
    "which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical\n",
    "attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it\n",
    "is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the\n",
    "contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a\n",
    "perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called\n",
    "literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something\n",
    "like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of\n",
    "a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing\n",
    "fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the\n",
    "poet’s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those\n",
    "who could read so good a poem as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be\n",
    "satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own\n",
    "advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at\n",
    "it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part\n",
    "of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn\n",
    "from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most\n",
    "cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because\n",
    "Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to\n",
    "ἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from\n",
    "us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s\n",
    "fine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up his\n",
    "translation as what a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still\n",
    "dismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the\n",
    "consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books\n",
    "before they have read its fellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up\n",
    "without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any\n",
    "writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested\n",
    "with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular\n",
    "excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a\n",
    "wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most\n",
    "excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the\n",
    "invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:\n",
    "the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which\n",
    "masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art\n",
    "with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but\n",
    "“steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on\n",
    "managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works\n",
    "of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the\n",
    "invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can\n",
    "only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,\n",
    "which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more\n",
    "entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are\n",
    "inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and\n",
    "fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue\n",
    "their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to\n",
    "comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\n",
    "beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\n",
    "number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,\n",
    "which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of\n",
    "which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,\n",
    "each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things\n",
    "are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if\n",
    "others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because\n",
    "they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute\n",
    "that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no\n",
    "man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.\n",
    "What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing\n",
    "moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,\n",
    "or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or\n",
    "done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by\n",
    "the force of the poet’s imagination, and turns in one place to a\n",
    "hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles\n",
    "that of the army he describes,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Οἵδ’ ἄῤ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πἆσα νέμοιτο.\n",
    "\n",
    "“They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.” It\n",
    "is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous,\n",
    "is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its\n",
    "fullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and\n",
    "others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity.\n",
    "Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,\n",
    "may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this “vivida\n",
    "vis animi,” in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect\n",
    "or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even\n",
    "while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with\n",
    "absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing\n",
    "but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned\n",
    "as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but\n",
    "everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in\n",
    "sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a\n",
    "furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in\n",
    "Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from\n",
    "heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and\n",
    "everywhere irresistibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in\n",
    "a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent\n",
    "parts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which\n",
    "distinguishes him from all other authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the\n",
    "violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed\n",
    "not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole\n",
    "compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward\n",
    "passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all\n",
    "the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but\n",
    "wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and\n",
    "boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in\n",
    "the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul of\n",
    "poetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with\n",
    "considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak\n",
    "of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for\n",
    "fiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\n",
    "marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,\n",
    "though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;\n",
    "or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional\n",
    "episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of\n",
    "an epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in\n",
    "Italy,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of Achilles,” the\n",
    "most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet\n",
    "this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and\n",
    "crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and\n",
    "episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose\n",
    "schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is\n",
    "hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration\n",
    "employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a\n",
    "genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as\n",
    "a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s\n",
    "poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The\n",
    "other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\n",
    "so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\n",
    "action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor\n",
    "is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\n",
    "invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of\n",
    "story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up\n",
    "their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,\n",
    "Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)\n",
    "destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses\n",
    "visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent\n",
    "after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of\n",
    "Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be\n",
    "absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,\n",
    "Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he\n",
    "gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the\n",
    "same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close\n",
    "imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the\n",
    "want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking\n",
    "of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from\n",
    "Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea\n",
    "and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those\n",
    "innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy\n",
    "which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,\n",
    "what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!\n",
    "How fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all\n",
    "the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues\n",
    "and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions\n",
    "agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in\n",
    "which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever\n",
    "commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for\n",
    "their invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment\n",
    "in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the\n",
    "following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then\n",
    "became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it\n",
    "was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy\n",
    "circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand\n",
    "upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all\n",
    "those allegorical parts of a poem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially\n",
    "the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the\n",
    "deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems\n",
    "the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and\n",
    "such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find\n",
    "those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,\n",
    "constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support\n",
    "of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\n",
    "philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,\n",
    "that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have\n",
    "been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:\n",
    "every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the\n",
    "various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day\n",
    "the gods of poetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\n",
    "author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a\n",
    "variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.\n",
    "Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could\n",
    "have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by\n",
    "their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has\n",
    "observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single\n",
    "quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters\n",
    "of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of\n",
    "Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that\n",
    "of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:\n",
    "the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;\n",
    "that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we\n",
    "find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and\n",
    "generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be\n",
    "found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each\n",
    "character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to\n",
    "give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters\n",
    "of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,\n",
    "that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,\n",
    "open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and\n",
    "this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of\n",
    "his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\n",
    "upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these\n",
    "kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open\n",
    "manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,\n",
    "where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to\n",
    "those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of\n",
    "Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and\n",
    "we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of\n",
    "Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of\n",
    "Statius’s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the\n",
    "same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,\n",
    "Hippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem\n",
    "brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this\n",
    "tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic\n",
    "writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,\n",
    "the invention of Homer was to that of all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;\n",
    "being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,\n",
    "of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the\n",
    "Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. “Everything in\n",
    "it has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is\n",
    "acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how\n",
    "small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the\n",
    "dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches\n",
    "often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be\n",
    "equally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of\n",
    "his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape\n",
    "being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of\n",
    "the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in\n",
    "Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests\n",
    "us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil\n",
    "leaves us readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same\n",
    "presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his\n",
    "thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part\n",
    "Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the\n",
    "grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they\n",
    "have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his\n",
    "Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.\n",
    "And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if\n",
    "Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so\n",
    "many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises\n",
    "into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\n",
    "invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\n",
    "comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance\n",
    "of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\n",
    "fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various\n",
    "views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions\n",
    "taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full\n",
    "prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side\n",
    "views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as\n",
    "the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the\n",
    "Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no\n",
    "one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that\n",
    "no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of\n",
    "noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,\n",
    "horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of\n",
    "images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted\n",
    "himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil\n",
    "especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from\n",
    "his master.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright\n",
    "imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We\n",
    "acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught\n",
    "that “language of the gods” to men. His expression is like the\n",
    "colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on\n",
    "boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and\n",
    "most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.\n",
    "Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out\n",
    "“living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than\n",
    "in any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing,\n",
    "a weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet\n",
    "his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in\n",
    "proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\n",
    "diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the\n",
    "same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,\n",
    "as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass\n",
    "in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a\n",
    "greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the\n",
    "heat more intense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected\n",
    "the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper\n",
    "to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted\n",
    "and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise\n",
    "conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last\n",
    "consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of\n",
    "his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of\n",
    "supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were\n",
    "joined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet\n",
    "Κορυθαίολος, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Εἰνοσίφυλλος,\n",
    "and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted\n",
    "upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a\n",
    "single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\n",
    "action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these\n",
    "epithets is a short description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\n",
    "share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not\n",
    "satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of\n",
    "Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this\n",
    "particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered\n",
    "these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and\n",
    "accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater\n",
    "smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has\n",
    "a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its\n",
    "custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make\n",
    "the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.\n",
    "With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the\n",
    "feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its\n",
    "accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the\n",
    "licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his\n",
    "sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his\n",
    "rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in\n",
    "the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all\n",
    "these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not\n",
    "only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so\n",
    "great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses,\n",
    "even without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we\n",
    "daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more\n",
    "sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of\n",
    "poetry.\"\"\""
